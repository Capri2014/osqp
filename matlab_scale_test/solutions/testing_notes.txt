test1 : standard problem configuration.  Convergence check on unscaled residuals

test2 : standard problem configuration.  Convergence check on scaled residuals

test3 : primal then dual pre-scaling.  Convergence check on scaled residuals

! test4:  primal pre-scaling only.  Convergence check on scaled residuals

test5:  dual pre-scaling only.  Convergence check on scaled residuals

test6: standard problem configuration, alpha = 1.  Convergence check on scaled residuals.

test7: manual perfect scaling with my Ruiz method, inf norm.  Convergence check on scaled residuals.

test8: manual perfect scaling with my Ruiz method, 2 norm.  Convergence check on scaled residuals.

test9: standard problem configuration, but with 2 norm Ruiz scaling.  Convergence check on scaled residuals.  IOW, test 2 but with Ruiz=2.

test10: standard problem configuration, but with 1 norm Ruiz scaling.  Convergence check on scaled residuals.  IOW, test 2 but with Ruiz=1.

test11: manual perfect scaling with my Ruiz method, 1 norm.  Convergence check on scaled residuals.

test12:  primal pre-scaling only, Ruiz 1 norm.  Convergence check on scaled residuals

test13:  primal pre-scaling only, Rui 2 norm.  Convergence check on scaled residuals

test14:  primal pre-scaling only, Ruiz inf norm.  Convergence check on scaled residuals.  (Sanity check, should be same as test4)

test15:  same as test 4 (primal scaling), but with max iter = 500

test16:  same as test 4 (primal scaling), but with max iter = 150

test17:  same as test 4 (primal scaling), but with max iter = 50

test18:  same as test 4 (primal scaling), but with primal pre-scaling with 1 norm

test19:  same as test 4 (primal scaling), but with primal pre-scaling with inf norm

test20:  same as test 18 (1-norm primal scaling), but with Ruiz 1 norm;

! test21:  same as test 18 (1-norm primal scaling), but with Ruiz 2 norm;

! test22:  1 norm primal/dual pre-scaling, Ruiz 2 norm;

test23: non-convex joint scaling.  Ruiz 2 norm;

test24: non-convex joint scaling.  Ruiz 1 norm;

test25: non-convex joint scaling.  Ruiz inf norm;


SO FAR, 4, 18 and 21, 22 are best.  22 is not much different from 21?
